Developed an interactive web-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Implemented dynamic feedback for user guesses, including input validation and score tracking, to enhance the user experience. Focused on creating a responsive and visually appealing interface, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate front-end technologies and improve user engagement through intuitive design.
